Topics Covered / Learning Outcomes

• Excel: Analysing data is crucial for us to understand it. Throughout these exercises, data analysis is performed with the help of excel tables, pivot tables, regression, modeling, forecasting, and valuation.

• Data Integrity: The most critical characteristic and skill of a Financial Analyst is data integrity. The ability to spot anomalous data and illogical results define a superior analyst. The examples include dozens of examples scattered throughout the course reinforcing its critical importance and considering it an essential component for decision-making.

• Data Analysis: We are amidst an explosion in data as computing becomes ubiquitous and the economy becomes fully digitized. As gigabytes and terabytes become petabytes and zettabytes, data is becoming critical to almost every aspect of a business. The ability to analyze data has become paramount to informed decision-making. Thus, data analysis has become a required skill in financial and non-financial corporate roles. While data analysis is often a specific major (and Data Science a specific Master’s program), every finance student can benefit from basic data analytical skills. In this course, each Workbook includes data analyses to explore the financial topic on hand. Testing a ‘Disruptive Digitization’ hypothesis, students will perform an analysis of a database of the financial results of the S&P 500 over several decades to identify and analyze the dramatic changes in corporate financial structures.

• Business Strategy: Business strategy is interwoven throughout the course. We view it as critical to perform informed financial and data analyses and make insightful decisions and recommendations. Students learn concepts such as economies/diseconomies of scale, barriers to entry, network effects, competitive cost position, cyclicality, and others. As part of a presentation of competitive strategy, we introduce students to Porter’s Five Forces, BCG’s Growth-Share Matrix, and Game Theory (prisoner’s dilemma).

• Financial Statement Analysis: We will rely extensively on the financial disclosures of actual companies, utilizing 10Ks and case studies to financial statement analyses and interpret the meaning of financial statement analysis ratios in the context of real-world companies, their business models, and operating environments.

• Modeling: We will learn to develop Excel-based models and use these models to perform scenario testing and sensitivity analyses. In addition to modeling corporate financial statements, students will also learn to develop financial models to depict and analyze: market size, capital projects, subscription-based revenue models, product cost models, budgets, and budget variances.

• Forecasting: The class will utilize a proprietary Strategic Financial Analysis Model (SFAM) derived from a practicing Wall Street Equity Analyst’s model to analyze and forecast the financial statements of actual companies. Students will learn multiple forecasting approaches (statistical, judgmental/hypothesis-based, fundamental) and will use trend analysis, peer comparisons, industry supply-demand, and others to do so. Students will also forecast models of the underlying business fundamentals including customer acquisition, market share, distribution channels, and market segmentation.

• Valuation: We will use Excel models to explore an array of valuation techniques including P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA, and DCF. We will make decisions to forecast the impacts of our assessment of the valuation.

• Decision-making: We will also determine which analytical tools to apply and evaluate the results via interactive problems solving sessions meant to duplicate a real-world business setting. The ability to develop informed judgments and formulate sound conclusions is a key educational outcome. The course is delivered as an interactive workshop in which the “what do the numbers say”, “if this, then what” and the “so what” is always front and center. You will have many opportunities to synthesize findings and draw conclusions.
